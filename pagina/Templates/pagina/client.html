         <h1 class="display-4 text-primary text-xs-center p-b-1 m-b-1">Bootstrap 4 Responsive Type Scale</h1>
         <p class="lead">OK, so we know Bootstrap does not come with a responsive type scale as such, but it does come with all you need to set one up. This is my way of getting things set up to help overcome a couple of dislikes I have when browsing through the web.</p>
         <p>I have an issuse with <abbr title="Responsive Web Design" class="initialism">RWD</abbr> at the moment and that is the way <em>some</em> sites seem quite happy to fill a mobile screen with a page title or heading. Lets try and rectify that.</p>
         <p>Take a quick read over the <a href="https://v4-alpha.getbootstrap.com/content/typography/#responsive-typography">Responsive Typograpy</a> section of the V4 docs. This will let you understand exactly what Bootstrap sets up for you and how so we know were to start.</p>
         <p>The next thing to consider is some details I read over on <a href="https://css-tricks.com/rems-ems/">CSS Tricks about the use of rems and ems.</a> The only issue you will come across if you want to implement this kind strategey when using Bootstrap is that V4 sets all the typography <code>font-size</code>'s with rem. If you want to use the suggestion from CSS Tricks you will need to either override the styles as done in this pen or edit the cource code.</p>
